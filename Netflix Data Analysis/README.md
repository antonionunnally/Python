In this data analysis project tutorial, I use Python and Juypter Notebook to draw insights from a Netflix dataset which contains information about 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform. This analysis helps us understanding what content is available in different countries, identify similar content by matching text-based features, a network analysis of Actors / Directors and helps us find interesting insights.

This project is built to meet the following requirements of Python of Code Louisville January 2021 session.

Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
The dataset is from the Kaggle website.

This project was written in the Jupyter notebook. The following packages were imported in this project:

import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns

How to run this project:

Start with Netflix Data Analysis Project.ipynb.

You must install jupyter labs to run the code in the jupyter notebook

Once in the jupyter notebook, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the project files. (You should see the .ipynb file, and "data" folder needed to run this project).

Open the .ipynb file.

You may need to install the following packages. Open terminal and run the following commands to install each package: Pip install pandas pip install seaborn

Go back to the jupyter notebooks. You see we are now importing these packages. So you should be able to run the code now.

Select "Kernel" (top ribbon) and "Restart and run all cells."
